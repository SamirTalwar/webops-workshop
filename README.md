# Web Ops

At lightning speed, this workshop will cover the bits that aren’t code that make up a working web app. These include servers, monitoring, deployment mechanisms, logging, alerting, secret management, recovery mechanisms… you get the idea.

It's not clear how far we'll get in two hours but material will be provided afterwards so you can finish anything off on your own.

You'll work in pairs on a virtual machine (which will be provided a few days beforehand so you have time to set it up).

Topics include:

  * how to set up a web server on Linux,
  * deploying changes to a web server with minimum downtime,
  * keeping an eye on your server to make sure things are working,
  * tracking down production bugs,
  * managing persistent data (such as your database),
  * secure communication over HTTPS,
  * and, if we have time, how to do all this in the buzzword of the decade, containers.

If you're participating in this workshop, you'll need to follow the [prerequisites][Prerequisites] well beforehand.

If you want to go through it on your own, follow the [playbook][Playbook].
