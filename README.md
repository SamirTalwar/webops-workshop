# Web Ops

At lightning speed, this workshop will cover the bits that aren’t code that make up a working web app. These include servers, monitoring, deployment mechanisms, logging, alerting, secret management, recovery mechanisms… you get the idea.

Topics include:

  * how to set up a web server on Linux,
  * deploying changes to a web server with zero downtime,
  * keeping an eye on your server to make sure things are working,
  * tracking down production bugs,
  * managing persistent data (such as your database),
  * secure communication over HTTPS,
  * and, if we have time, how to do all this in the buzzword of the decade, containers.

The workshop is designed to run on Unix-like machine such as Linux or macOS. If you're running on Windows, we can make it work, but it won't be quite so true to real life.

## Following along at home

If you want to go through it on your own, follow the [prerequisites][Prerequisites], then the [playbook][Playbook].

## Running this workshop yourself

You're welcome to run this workshop yourself by following the [playbook][Playbook] and making changes as necessary.

You'll need to follow the [prerequisites][Prerequisites] ahead of the workshop, and ask students to run the client-side preparation in that document. I recommend you do a dry run yourself.

All I ask is that:

1. you tell me you're running it (you can reach me [over Twitter][@SamirTalwar] or [via email][samir@noodlesandwich.com]),
2. you send feedback about how you found it, and
3. if you find problems, you tell me about them (or even send pull requests).

Good luck!
